# Presentation for [SIAM UQ16](https://www.siam.org/meetings/uq16/)

## Chaospy: A modular implementation of polynomial chaos expansions and Monte Carlo methods

Chaospy is a Python toolbox specifically developed to implement polynomial chaos
expansions and advanced Monte Carlo methods. The toolbox is highly modular with a
programming syntax close to the mathematical theory.

This talk will consists of an implementation walk-through with theoretical
review and practical examples. The focus will be on (non-intrusive) methods
where the software for the underlying model can be reused without modifications.
